# sorting-phase
A series of scripts for performing sort operations on musical phrases to create musical works. The name "Sorting Phase" is in reference to Steve Reich's Phase Musics.

## concept
Extending Steve Reich's concept of "Phases" (which were themselves an extension of canons and fugues), sorting phase is an example of music as an expression of a process. It is an exploration on the procedural underpinnings of sorting algorithms realized as a means of iteration of a musical theme or phrase. This repository is a collection of tools I've created to explore the potential of compositional technique.

## description
These scripts utilize Reapers Scripting API (Reascript) to facilitate the manipulation of midi items in reaper. Soon I will include descriptions and explanations of each script and how it is designed to be used in the Reaper environment. Someday I'd like to create a standalone app for editing midi files and/or an Ableton Live 10/ Max For Live Object version of these tools. First things first: Reascript is great and robust and it is what I know.
